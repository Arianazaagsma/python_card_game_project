# python_war_card_game

# This was a project I started in my Nucamp Python bootcamp. While it works as it should for the most part, there are still a few bugs that I am trying to work through. One of the biggest challenges is when a "war" situations happens twice in a row - meaning that at the end of a round of "war", the two players draw the same card again and initiate a second round of "war".
